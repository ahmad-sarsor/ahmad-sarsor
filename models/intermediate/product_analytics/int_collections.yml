    description: |
      Intermediate view that standardizes collection (list) data from the MySQL `collection` table.  
      This model renames fields to a consistent naming convention (`list_*`) and parses key metadata including creation and modification timestamps.  
      It distinguishes between `creator_id` and `owner_id`, preserving both for downstream flexibility.
